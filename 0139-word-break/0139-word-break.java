/* Here initially I would iterate over the entire string s and have the substring compare with my words present in the worddict.
But before that I have to check initially that i < word.length - 1. If this condition satisfies I do not need to check as I have less characters on the left to compare with the word. Once this condition gets satisfied. I would check if the num of chars == word.length - 1(i == word.length - 1). Or else even if dp[i - word.length()] is true. Because it might be possible that I have processed the first 4 and only want to check for the next 4. Once this condition is satisfied I compare the substrings and then change the index in the dp array accordingly. Lastly I check the boolean value of the last index in the dp array. */
