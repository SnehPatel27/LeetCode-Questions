/*Time complexity
You would traverse the matrix once in the worst case. that would be m * n.
The recursive depth in this would be L that is the length of the string. 
In this in the first case you have 4 options. like for instance from A -> B you have 4 choices and then you choose 1. But for the next when you reach B. You cannot come back to A so here you only have 3 options. 

So total time complexity would be O(m * n * 3^L).

Space Complexity: Call stack depth: up to L â†’ O(L)
